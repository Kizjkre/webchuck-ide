## Building

Build WebChucK IDE to a static site by running:

```

This will build WebChucK IDE and place all necessary files in the `./dist` folder.

## Deploy and Release

To package and release a new version of WebChucK IDE, make sure all changes are 
PR'ed onto the `main` branch. From `main`, make a clean build of WebChucK IDE, 
then tag the version for release.

```
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build
npm version patch
```

Copy the `./dist/` folder to hosting destination.
